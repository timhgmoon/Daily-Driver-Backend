***Our Project***
‚ú® What is it? A task manager (connected to-do lists) for web development teams... just like us!
‚ú®  What does it do? It organizes tasks for software engineers who are working together on a coding project.

***Pages***
- *Landing Page*: explains project. 
- *Make a New Project Page*: allows you to add team members to a new project. (Post-MVP)
- *Task Management Page*: includes team members and a limited view of their specific tasks.
- *Individual Dev Tasks Page*: includes complete task list in more detail (task, file, priority, completed, needHelp...). Allows you to "flag" an individual as needing help. Allows you to clear completed tasks. 
- *Unassigned Tasks Page*: here are some tasks that have yet to be assigned to an individual team member, they are "up for grabs" for team members to assign to themselves or others.  
- *About Us Page*: (required page) with photos, one-line bios, and links to our individual portfolio sites. No big functionality here besides functioning links. 

***User Stories***
ü§î Who are our users, what do they want, and why?
Our users are... us! Development Teams looking to organize themselves and work together more efficiently. 

***Wire Frames***

***Challenges*** 
üèî Descriptions of any unsolved problems or hurdles our team had to overcome.
Project Schema: We would've liked to add three levels of schema. We wanted to have tasks embedded within members embedding with projects. Taylor and Tim actually spent one full day on trying to make this happen but ultimately scrapped this plan when we realized it wasn't our top priority. Kyle was so far along in the front-end React routes that it would have caused him to have re-do a lot of his work.

**Presentation** TBD
*Introduction*
- What's your app called? *Daily Driver*
- Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?
    Front-End Devs: 
    - Kyle: React routing expert.
    - Brandon: CSS styling and animations expert. 
    Back-End Devs:
    - Taylor: schema-creator, embedding expert, heroku/mongodb-atlas deployment central. Pair programmed with Tim.  
    - Tim: schema-creator, embedding expert, heroku/mongodb-atlas deployment central. Pair-programmed with Taylor. 
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"? *Daily Driver* helps development teams drive towards efficiency and prevent conflicts by centralizing a to do list that is viewable and editable by all team members. 

*Demonstrating Your App*
- What are the integral features of your app? The integral features of our app are: being able to add a team member and being able to add a task to a specific team member. Other important, related functionality is: editing and deleting both tasks and members. 

*Demonstrating Your Code*
- What was the most difficult part? By far, the most difficult part was working on GitHub and managing any merge conflicts that came up. 
- What did you learn? We learned to work through issues together, never alone. 
- What are you most proud of? We are proud of working together to complete a project and supporting each other in difficult times and always remaining a calm, strong team. We may have had merge conflicts, but we never had inter-personal conflicts. 

*The Planning Process*
- How did you arrive at this idea? Taylor pitched two ideas and asked Kyle, Tim and Brandon for feedback. The team voted on the first idea with modifications. We wireframed together to make sure we were all clear on our basic plan.  
- How did you decide who would have which responsibilities? Kyle had a strong interest in setting up the React routing. Brandon has a passion for CSS. Taylor and Tim were up for anything, so we split up along these lines with the idea of helping each other with any problems that arose. 
- What would you change about your planning process? We think it was more successful to have teams pair program on their repo (front or back) because that prevented many merge conflicts as opposed to working on separate files. 

*The Workflow*
- What was your Git Workflow? We usually started off together in the same break-out room in the morning, then split up into front-end and back-end rooms, coming back together some time in the afternoon to work through issues together. 
- What did you like about this workflow; what did you dislike? This allowed us to get a good sense of what was going on at all levels. 
- Did you run into any challenges with this workflow? How did you solve them?

*The Week*
- What was your week like? Our week was very productive and we put in time during the weekend and days off. 
- Did you feel the Emotional Cycle of Change? We all definitely felt an emotional roller coaster as challenges arose. 
- How did you work together? We worked together very well, no one fought, no one had interpersonal conflicts. 

*Highs and Lows*
- What worked well? Pair and mob programming worked well for our team. In the beginning of the process, planning together to have a clear vision was very helpful to set us all out on the right path. Additionally, screen-sharing during terminal commands helped catch a lot of small mistakes we were making. 
- What didn't? When we didn't commit and push our code often, we ran into a lot of merge conflicts. 
- What features would you like to add? We would've liked to add three levels of schema. We wanted to have tasks embedded within members embedding with projects. Taylor and Tim actually spent one full day on trying to make this happen but ultimately scrapped this plan when we realized it wasn't our top priority. Kyle was so far along in the front-end React routes that it would have caused him to have re-do a lot of his work.
